    "so how do we avoid such problems but we need to have some rules that were going to consider when were implementing our recursive algorithms \n",
    "- and there are four basic rules that we have for recursive algorithms rule number one is that we must have a base case so a recursive algorithm must always have a base case which can be solved without recursion and we saw in the example with the fCount function/method that the base case there was in fact if the value of fCount reached two that would be solved with out recursion so any call to the fCount function/method with a value of two or above can be solved without recursion that means wed have a base case and function/methods without a base case would of course result in infinite recursion when theyre running so its very important to consider a base case or a simple instance of the problem which can be solved without recursion rule number two is that with every recursive call we must make progress towards that base case our base cases we could have more than one base case but we have to make progress towards the base case in each recursive call so for cases that are to be resolved solved recursively the next call must be a case that makes progress towards the base case function/methods that do not follow this rule ie they do not make progress towards the base case would result in circular recursion when theyre wrong like in the example on the previous slide the third rule when designing recursive algorithms is called the design rule and the design rule has to assume that all the recursive calls which we make will work what do we mean by that? well really we mean that if were at a higher level in recursion we assume that the next recursive call that we make will carry out his task as expected and will return so we have to assume that any recursive call that were going to make will follow basically the previous two rules that it will make progress towards the base case and that it will actually reach that base case eventually and that eventually all the nested levels of recursion will return one by one and that those will work as expected the final rule for recursive algorithms and this rule relates to efficiency or efficient use of computational resources this is called the compound interest rule and the compound interest rule says that we should never duplicate work by solving the same instance of a problem in separate recursive calls so we should structure our recursive algorithm in such a way that we are not actually repeating the same work or the same call over and over again in separate recursive instances because thats not a good use of computation resources and if we find in fact that we are i guess duplicating a lot of the same types of calls are same problem instances then in that case we should probably look at an iterative approach or an iterative implementation to solve our problem instead of using recursion so taking all of that together as a whole all the issues weve talked about so far in relation to recursive algorithms how would we actually go about designing and implementing recursive algorithm? well the very first and most fundamental step which we must take is to just think about the task which you wish to accomplish and we try to identify any recurring patterns or any patterns that wed see again so basically we look out for similar operations that must be conducted for example the trevor traversing through nested directories on a file system problem thats a problem that naturally lends itself to recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "or to a recursive solution so that process of looking through every file in the directory and see if we want to search for a file and then going into the directory below it or etc that is a fundamentally recursive process so we want to maybe divide that problem up using these recurring operations so the idea of maybe looking at every file in a folder and then moving on to the next four folder below you know that would be the most fundamental recurring operation that happens when were traversing through directories in a file system so after weve broken our larger problem up into the smallest i guess instance that we can the smallest recording instance and then we need to identify those cases which we know could be solved without recursion so that could be a single base case or you could have multiple base cases and in the example of traversing through directories on a file system that would be the deepest nested directory on the file system for example would be the recursive case because no more recursive calls would happen below that are nested deeper within so once weve divided the problem up we need to identify those cases which could be solved without recursion and so a good or well designed recursive algorithm would not end in a multitude of special cases rather the goal for us is to identify just one simple base case are just a very few very simple base cases that could be solved without recursion and those will actually act as a stop or prevent infinite recursion then we need to design our algorithm in such a way that will invoke a new copy of the function/method with each recursive step and will modify the input parameters so each recursive call would have like a different initialisation conditions are a different input and each recursive stack will then actually resemble the original larger problem and then finally with each recursive step or each recursive call we want to ensure that were going to make progress towards the base case our base cases with each successive call taking that all information that that how one would divide a problem up and begin to think about how to solve it in a recursive fashion so just to recap quickly on the material we covered today the main takeaway concept here is that recursion allows us to solve some problem by breaking it up into smaller instances of the same problem and therefore a recursive function/method is a function/method which calls itself within its own function/method body so we may want to use recursion versus an iterative approach because it allows for cleaner code and intuitively some problems may be more easily solved by taking a recursive approach so it quite often leads to cleaner code that is more maintainable and easier to understand we also examined some of the main design rules for recursive algorithms and we illustrate the importance of a base case in recursion where we said that a base case is a case which can be solved without recursion so it is an input instance for the algorithm or for the function/method which may be solved without making a recursive call so in the next lecture were going to consider some example problems which may be solved using recursion\n",
